## Description

Firewalls are a critical component of network security, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. This repository contains various shellcodes that can be used to test the robustness of firewall rules. Each shellcode is crafted to exploit common weaknesses and misconfigurations found in firewall setups.

The shellcodes are categorized based on their type and the specific firewall challenges they are designed to address.
